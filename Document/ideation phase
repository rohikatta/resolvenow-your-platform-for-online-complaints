o Notes: Ongoing effort vital for trust.
· Role-based access control for agent/admin:
o Impact: High | Effort: High | Priority: Major Project
o Notes: Limits data exposure.
This document defines key problem statements derived directly from John's Empathy Map, focusing on the
challenges and frustrations he experiences related to product defects and the complaint resolution process.
Addressing these problems will be central to the success of the Online Complaint Registration and
Management System.
1. Lack of Transparency and Control
Problem Statement: John lacks real-time, easily accessible information regarding the status and progress of
his complaint, leading to uncertainty and a feeling of being uninformed.
· Derived from Empathy Map (THINKS): "Will they take me seriously?", "Progress is reassuring." (implies
lack of initial reassurance).
· Derived from Empathy Map (DOES): "Monitors status (email/dashboard)." (indicates active seeking of
information due to initial lack).
· Derived from Empathy Map (FEELS): "Frustrated (initial)," "Relieved & Informed" (only upon receiving
updates, highlighting initial problem).
2. Cumbersome and Inefficient Initial Complaint Submission
Problem Statement: The traditional methods of initiating a complaint are often perceived as complex and
time-consuming, creating an initial barrier for users like John.
· Derived from Empathy Map (SAYS): "'Hope process is easy.'"
· Derived from Empathy Map (DOES): "Searches & Registers." (highlights effort needed to even start).
· Derived from Empathy Map (FEELS): "Frustrated (initial)," "Cautiously Optimistic" (implies a hurdle
was overcome or anticipated).
3. Communication Gaps and Redundancy
Problem Statement: John experiences inefficient communication channels where he may need to repeat
information, or where direct interaction with a responsible party is not immediate or streamlined.
· Derived from Empathy Map (SAYS): "'Updates & chat good.'" (implies this wasn't always the case).
"'No calls, great!'" (highlights aversion to traditional phone calls).
· Derived from Empathy Map (DOES): "Chats with agent." (indicates the solution to a prior problem).
· Derived from Empathy Map (THINKS): "Will they take me seriously?" (can be tied to
poor communication leading to feeling unheard).
4. Concerns Regarding Data Security and Privacy
Problem Statement: John has underlying concerns about the security and privacy of his personal and
complaint-related data when submitting sensitive information.
· Derived from Empathy Map (THINKS): "'Is my data safe? (Privacy)'."
· Derived from Empathy Map (FEELS): "Secure" (only due to perceived system robustness, implying an
initial concern).
Conclusion
These problem statements succinctly summarize the core pain points John faces during the complaint
resolution process. By focusing on providing transparent tracking, simplifying submission, streamlining
communication, and ensuring robust data security, the Online Complaint Registration and Management
System can effectively address these issues, leading to a much improved and more satisfying user experience
for customers like John.
This report details the foundational Empathize & Discover phase for the Online Complaint Registration and
Management System. This critical initial stage is dedicated to gaining a profound understanding of the
project's context, the target users, their needs, pain points, and the environment in which the system will
operate. By empathizing with our users, we lay the groundwork for a truly user-centric design that effectively
addresses real-world problems.
Understanding the Empathize & Discover Phase
The "Empathize & Discover" phase is the cornerstone of any successful design and development process. It
involves deep immersion into the world of our users to understand their experiences, motivations, and
frustrations. This phase is characterized by gathering diverse perspectives and data, moving beyond
assumptions to uncover genuine insights.
Key Objectives of this Phase:
· Uncover User Needs: Identify explicit and implicit needs, challenges, and goals of all stakeholders
who will interact with the system (customers, agents, administrators).
· Map User Journeys: Understand the current processes users follow, highlighting touchpoints,
emotions, and friction points.
· Define Problem Statements: Clearly articulate the specific problems the system aims to solve.
· Establish Context: Grasp the organizational, technical, and regulatory environment.
· Build Empathy: Foster a deep understanding of users' perspectives to inform design decisions.
Key Activities Undertaken:
1. Stakeholder Interviews: Conducted in-depth interviews with potential customers (like John),
customer service agents (like Sarah), and system administrators to gather first-hand accounts of their
current experiences, challenges, and desired improvements.
2. User Observation (Simulated): Analyzed existing complaint handling scenarios and identified typical
user behaviors and pain points.
3. Competitive Analysis: Researched existing complaint management solutions to understand market
trends, best practices, and potential areas for differentiation.
4. Requirements Gathering: Collected and documented functional and non-functional requirements
based on user insights and business objectives.
5. Regulatory Compliance Research: Initiated investigation into relevant data protection regulations
and industry-specific compliance requirements to ensure the system's design adheres to necessary
standards.
